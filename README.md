# credit-risk-classification
Module 20 Challenge
This challenge is to read in a csv with lending data, split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split, creating a logistic regression model, testing additional models to determine the best model, and writing a Credit Risk Analysis Report.
After testing predictions, the model's performances were evaluated using a generated confusion matrix and a printed classification report. Multiple models were tested to determine the best choice.
The Credit Risk Analysis Report includes a summary and analysis of the performance of the mahcine learning models used in this homework as well as a recommendation for the model with the best fit.
